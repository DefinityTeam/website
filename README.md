# Definity Website
## Introduction
This repository hosts the Definity website. It's made entirely in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)/JavaScript using [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [EJS](https://ejs.co), to make hosting it yourself easier.

By default, it runs on port 80 (as is standard), but you can modify it on the first line of `src/index.ts` / `dist/index.js`. **These values are ignored in production. Please make sure ports 80 and 443 are available.**

## Running
Open a terminal, and setup if you haven't done `git clone` yet:
```
$ > git clone https://github.com/DefinityTeam/website
$ > cd website
$ > npm ci --only=production
```
Starting in development: `npm run start`</br>
Starting in production: `npm run start -- --prod`

## Building
```
$ > npm ci
$ > npm run build
```
(Yes, it's that easy.)

## Contributing
When contributing to the main/parent repository, it is recommended to use `npm run watch`. When you make changes to the directory, or any `.ts`/`.json` file, `nodemon` will automatically restart the server.

Once you've finished your changes, ^C and `npm run build`. After that, you're good to go.
